Description: The main goal of this package is to estimate coefficient matrices in high-dimensional positive-definite covariance regression model. The package is based on the work of Jie He, Yumou Qiu & Xiao-hua Zhou, Positive-Definite Covariance on Scalar Regression]{Positive-Definite Regularized Estimation for High Dimensional Covariance on Scalar Regression(2024).
